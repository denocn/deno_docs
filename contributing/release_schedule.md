## Release Schedule {#release-schedule}

A new minor release for the `deno` cli is released every 6 weeks. A new patch
version is released weekly, except in the week before a new minor release.

The release dates for the upcoming minor releases are:

- 1.8.0: March 2nd, 2021
- 1.9.0: April 13, 2021

Stable releases can be found on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases).

### Canary channel {#canary-channel}

In addition to the stable channel described above, canaries are released
multiple times daily (for each commit on main). You can upgrade to the latest
canary release by running:

```
deno upgrade --canary
```

To update to a specific canary, pass the commit hash in the `--version` option:

```
deno upgrade --canary --version=973af61d8bb03c1709f61e456581d58386ed4952
```

To switch back to the stable channel, run `deno upgrade`.

Canaries can be downloaded from https://dl.deno.land.
